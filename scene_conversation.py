    """Your training should make you feel better. Workouts should be designed to be light enough that thereâ€™s 
almost no excuse to not do them. Once a rhythm is developed, you can turn the dial up. I need to think about wether 
it is better to load a lot of exercises onto a single day, or just do more days. There is a lot of startup cost in 
terms of warmups, etc. I need to improve my warmup game and get a lot more variation in there. Perhaps I can track 
warmups alongside the actual exercises that I do. 

Self control is limited. You should cultivate better self-control, but also build systems around your life 
so that you can apply it to the places that it matters most. A perfect example is optimizing the gym flow. Being able 
to throw on some clothes, grab a bag, and be in the gym in 5 minutes really leads to a great outcome.
